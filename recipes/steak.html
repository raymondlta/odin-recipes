        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by dry brining the steak at least 30 minutes prior to cooking. This can also be done overnight. To start this process, simply place your raw steak onto a well venilated surface such as a drying rack and sprinkle the salt on both sides of the steak. Afterwards, place the steak into the fridge.</li>
            <li>About 30 minutes prior to cooking, bring the steak out of the fridge to allow it to reach room temperature. This will allow for even cooking.</li>
            <li>At around 25 minutes, start preheating the air fryer by setting it to 450 degrees Farenheit.</li>
            <li>Once the air fryer is up to temp, place the steak into the air fryer and set a time for 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 7 minutes, flip the steak over and start another timer for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 3 minutes, place a knob of butter and the 2 cloves of garlic on top of the steak in the air fryer. Start another time for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>After another 3 minutes, pull the steak out of the air fryer and allow to cool on a plate for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the 10 minutes is up, you may enjoy your nice medium to medium-rare steak.</li>
